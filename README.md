# Projects

## picoCTF 2022

I am currently participating in the [picoCTF 2022 Hacking Competition](https://picoctf.org/competitions/2022-spring), in a group with some of my other engineering friends.
This competition is teaching me the basics of cybersecurity and extending my knowledge of tools such as the linux shell.

## [Quick-Carbs](https://github.com/l-bamf/l-bamf/blob/main/quick-carbs.md)

I am currently developing an Android application to help people quickly find the carbohydrate serving of pre-packaged alcoholic beverages.
This an issue because in Australia alcoholic drinks are exempt from displaying the nutritional content on the can or bottle unlike other, non-alcoholic, drinks.
This information is accessible online through the manufacturers themselves and third party websites such as [CalorieKing](https://www.calorieking.com/au/en/), but this is a relatively slow process with many irrelevant details the user doesn't need. My goal is to make the user experience quicker, and with less overhead.
