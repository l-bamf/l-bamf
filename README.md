# Personal Details

Hi, my name is Lewis Bamford and I am currently a fourth and final-year software engineering student at Monash University. 
This repository is for documenting my personal and university projects and giving insight into my experience.
I don't have any working code here because this is a public repository and that is insecure, I also don't believe many people reading this will be interested in the raw implementation.
My email dedicated to my personal projects is lewis.j.bamford@gmail.com. For student projects you can reach me at lbam0001@student.monash.edu.

# Projects

## AskPCOS

My final-year project ([FIT4002](https://handbook.monash.edu/2022/units/FIT4002)) is developing a goal-setting application which helps women with PCOS improve their physical and mental health.
The new features will be an extension of the existing [AskPCOS](https://www.askpcos.org/) progressive web-app, which gives information about PCOS, and a digitalisation of the current paper-based goal setting process.
This project is made up of many different parties: the development team (my team), a team of design students, our client (an academic researcher), the developers and maintainers of the original app, and of course the clients themselves. Collaborating with this number of different groups has been a new challenge.
This project has given me the opportunity to learn React and the AWS backend stack.

## picoCTF 2022

I participated in the [picoCTF 2022 Hacking Competition](https://picoctf.org/competitions/2022-spring), in a team with some of my other engineering friends.
This competition taught me the basics of cybersecurity and extended my knowledge of tools in the linux shell such as gdb and sleuthkit.
[Our team](https://play.picoctf.org/teams/3186) placed 2599 of 7794 point-scoring teams.

## [Drinktionary](https://github.com/l-bamf/l-bamf/blob/main/drinktionary.md)

I am currently developing an Android application to help people quickly find the carbohydrate serving of pre-packaged alcoholic beverages.
This an issue because in Australia alcoholic drinks are exempt from displaying the nutritional content on the can or bottle unlike other, non-alcoholic, drinks.
This information is accessible online through the manufacturers themselves and third party websites such as [CalorieKing](https://www.calorieking.com/au/en/), but this is a relatively slow process with many irrelevant details the user doesn't need. My goal is to make the user experience quicker, and with less overhead.

## [AutomaTTim](https://github.com/l-bamf/automaTTim)

Automating the process of entering TimTam's promotional competition and using this automation to exploit better odds during certain parts of the day
