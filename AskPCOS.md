# AskPCOS Project Basics

## Background information

### Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)

Key background information sourced from [healthdirect](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos).

> Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal condition that affects up to 1 in 10 girls and women in their reproductive years. It may cause disruptions to the menstrual cycle, skin and hair changes, as well as cysts on the ovaries. It is one of the leading causes of infertility, yet many women don't know they have it — many women with PCOS remain undiagnosed. PCOS can’t be cured, but if you have it you and your doctor can manage many of the symptoms.

> Treatment depends on the main problems you have. It can involve medicines, cosmetic treatments and having a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle is the main way to manage PCOS. Eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise can help many of the physical and emotional problems caused by PCOS. Exercise can improve your mental health too.

### Goal-setting

Monash Health currently runs a paper-based goal setting program for women with PCOS to help them manage their symptoms by pursuing better habits.
This involves setting SMART goals as part of an action plan, then reflecting on this plan's effeciveness weeks later.
A SMART goal is defined as one that is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and has a Timeframe.

### AskPCOS

Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation (MCHRI) is a partnership between Monash University and Monash Health to develop new systems and research in the health sector.
A couple years ago MCHRI developed the [AskPCOS](https://www.askpcos.org/) progressive-web and mobile applications to educate women on PCOS and its effects.

## Goal

The goal of my project is to digitise the current paper-based goal setting, and implement these features as an extension of the current AskPCOS app.
